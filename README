ColdFusion.js

This project is an experiment in moving some of the ColdFusion Application Framework (Application.cfc) concepts into a Node.js context. This includes centralized hooks into the various events of the ColdFusion.js lifecycle:

onApplicationStart() => callback( true | false )
onSessionStart()
onRequestStart() => callback( true | false )
onRequest()
onRequestEnd()
onSessionEnd()
onApplicationEnd()
onError() => true | false

These event handlers are defined in the Application.js file - a root-level module that exports these methods in a single constructor. None of the methods are requires. They are only used if they are present.

Like the ColdFusion application framework, session management can be managed on a per-request basis. Cookies can be overriden so that session cookies can be encrypted.
